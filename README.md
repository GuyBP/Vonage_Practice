Written by Guy Ben Pazi, Mars 2022.

## Purpose

Demonstrate Automation Testing skills by creating API & UI tests.

## How to run the project

1. Fork/download this repository to your machine.
2. Run the project by your favorite IDE, I used 'Visual Studio Code'.
3. On the terminal execute `npm install`, Cypress will be installed on your machine.
4. Run `npm run cypress:open` on the terminal, this will open Cypress UI.
5. In Cypress UI, to run the tests:

   a. All: click on `Run 2 integration specs`.

   b. UI/API only: click on the `specific file` you wish to run.
